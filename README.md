# Monad Node Diagnostics

A small collection of **safe, read-only diagnostic tools**
for inspecting the health and correctness of a running Monad node.

These tools are intended for:
- node operators
- validators
- infrastructure providers

They focus on **early detection of misconfiguration and failure conditions**
without modifying node state.

---

## Design Principles

- Read-only by default  
- Safe to run on live mainnet nodes  
- Deterministic and idempotent  
- No installation, staking, or consensus actions  

All tools are designed to **fail fast** and provide actionable output.

---

## Available Tools

### 🔍 `node-health-check.sh`

Performs a basic health inspection of a running node.

Checks include:
- required Monad services are running
- RPC endpoints are reachable
- block height is advancing
- local clock drift
- disk space and I/O saturation indicators

**Usage:**
```bash
./node-health-check.sh
```

### 🔑  `keystore-integrity-check.sh`

Validates the presence and consistency of local keystores.

Checks include:
- SECP and BLS keystore existence
- file permissions
- basic structural integrity
- mismatch between expected and discovered keys

This tool does not expose or export private key material.

### 🧠 `sync-state-inspector.sh`

Inspects node synchronization state.

Reports:
- current block height
- peer connectivity indicators
- sync stagnation detection
- common stuck-state patterns

### 💾 `triedb-sanity-check.sh`

Performs non-destructive checks against the TrieDB device.

Checks include:
- correct device mapping (/dev/triedb)
- block device properties
- LBA size validation
- basic read latency sampling

No data is written to disk.
